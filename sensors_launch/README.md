## Synopsis

`sensors_launch` contains supporting launchfiles to run the sensors stack

## Motivation

goat_launch launches too many parts of our code stack, so we wanted to make a separate sensors_launch that can be called to only launch the sensors code stack

## Installation

Clone this repository into your `catkin` workspace along with the sensors code stack, then run 'catkin build'

## Contributors

`sensors_launch` is authored by Gregory Meyer and currently maintained by Colin Yoon.
